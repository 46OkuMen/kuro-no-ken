## Reinserter
* Consistent crashes on loading certain reinserted dialog boxes. The "Don't look at me like that" box is the first one
	* No pointers, no differences in control codes. Different (bad) behavior depending on the length of the string.

## Dump
* What are the control codes?
	* \i0
	* \i2
	* \f
	* ;@

## Text Formatting
* The newline character indents each character by 2. Solution would be to put an extra " " in front of every initial quote character, and maybe every nametag.

## Images
* Haven't looked yet.
